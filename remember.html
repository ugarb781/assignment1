    <p><strong>I remember</strong></p>
    </h3>
    <ol>
    <li>that summer</li>
    <br>
    <li>A lifetime ago.</li>
    <br>
    <li>You were a boy</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I couldn't wait to get to know</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <li>I was but a girl.</li>
    <br>
    <li>We both were so young.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Mistakes yet to make...</li>
        <li>A lifetime to come...</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>It feels like only yesterday that I last spoke to you...</li>
      <li>Now you're a small town rumour, but I'm sure it can't be true... </li>
      <br>
    </ul>
    <ol start="6">
      <li>You smiled when you saw me</li>
      <li>And I smiled too.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol start="8">
      <li>Our last conversation;</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If only I knew.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I might've used your nickname</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Like I did years before</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>But I'm glad we said goodbye</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Before you headed out the door</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>It feels like only yesterday that I last spoke to you...</li>
      <li>Now you're a small town rumour, but I'm praying isn't true. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

  <ol start="9">
    <li>The news spread like whispers</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Around this small town.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <li>So long, see you later.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Won't see you around.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I never imagined</li>
      <ol>
        <li>It would go this way.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Can't quite believe it...</li>
        <br>
        <li>Don't know what to say...</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>

  </ol>
<br>
  <ul>
  <li>It feels like only yesterday that I last spoke to you...</li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="12">
    <li>Now you're a small town rumour, and I'm so sad that it's true.</li>
